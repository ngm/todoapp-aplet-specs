* Create vision and goals
* Create capabilities
* Create feature model and product map
* Create feature files with user scenarios
* Create feature backlog
* Create CI for products
* Create selected backlog for next sprint
* Planning of selected backlog
  * good first selected backlog would appear to be whatever is shared across all products
* Once we've done the basic features, that covers the first product
* Now I'll add another feature for a different product
* However - we need to get the CI matrix set up somehow
* Kind of also need to show that the first product doesn't have the feature it didn't expect
* Note: we're using annotative approach, compositional could be another
* Now implement the feature
